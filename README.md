<!-- # This is the most useless file in this codebase so feel free to just check some real codes in this codebase. -->
# So, as you are already here then hear me out. This is the most funny story related to shadcn/ui, I guess. 
* Time of the Event: (12/07/2024 - 09:25:18pm) // Also included seconds and realized it after pushing it. So I thought to keep it.

**So, I've been following shadcn/ui since its early days, even before it gained mainstream popularity. I knew this component library had the potential to become a major player, and I was right. As of writing, it has already surpassed 62k stars on GitHub, which is a fantastic achievement for a component library, especially a React one competing against established names like:**

1. Material UI (92.5k)
2. Ant Design (91.5k)
3. NextUI (20.6k) (Highly Underrated Library! Don't be discouraged by its star count. The components it provides rival those of the top two.)
4. Bootstrap (22.3k) (Good enough)
5. And so on...

You get the idea, right? This Shadcn guy is a true legend. Fun fact: I actually started using Twitter (or X) just to follow him.

By now, you can probably tell that I'm a huge fan of shadcn/ui. As I mentioned, I've been following the library since its inception. I was really interested in contributing one of my own components. I managed to create a cross-browser scrollbar and update the code sections for dark themes. However, at that time, I wasn't comfortable using Tailwind because I prefer good ol' CSS. (Hey, no judgment here, I love CSS too!) While I knew about Tailwind, I wasn't comfortable using it yet.

Despite having everything ready and creating a pull request, I ultimately didn't contribute to the library at that time. Back then, shadcn reviewed code submissions himself, and looking back, I realize I used hex colors when shadcn/ui utilizes HSL CSS variables. My unfamiliarity with Tailwind also played a role in not updating the code. Then, with my studies taking priority, 2023 passed by in a blur.

The first few months of 24 were similar, filled with academic commitments that kept me away from coding for a while. Once exams were over, I decided to try freelancing to earn some money. Unfortunately, it wasn't a smooth experience. Being from Bangladesh, Fiverr is arguably the most popular freelancing platform. However, back in 2022, while learning about Blockchain technology, I got my Fiverr account banned due to my lack of experience. A rookie mistake – I asked a client to use a payment method outside of Fiverr's system. This, of course, led to the ban. Discouraged by this experience, I decided to take a break from freelancing.

But then, in 2024, I was suddenly hit with the motivation to freelance again. (Let's just say Vitamin "M" deficiency played a part.) After my college exams ended in June, I realized I couldn't create a new Fiverr account due to the ban. Upwork, another well-known platform, became my next option. I had tried Upwork before in 2022 but hadn't received any client messages, so I stopped using it. This time, however, after two months of hard work, I managed to complete two projects for a measly $100. To make matters worse, I even got really sick during this period. Despite finishing the projects and delivering good results, I wasn't offered any further work. Talk about getting cheated!

Feeling defeated, I considered giving up freelancing again and focusing on personal projects and studies, especially since my last exams weren't ideal.

That's when I remembered my old goal of contributing to shadcn/ui. I wasn't surprised to learn that shadcn/ui had become incredibly popular in the meantime. Now, I'm determined to give contributing another shot.

**Here's to trying again! We all make mistakes, but the key is to laugh it off and keep moving forward.**

Thanks for listening to my not-so-boring story about my journey with shadcn/ui.

<!-- 
Story:
So, I followed shadcn/ui from the time it was not so popular but still it was so cool and beautiful. I knew this component library will definetly blow the current component library race. Yeah, I was right. It surely did, as the time I am writing this story it already crossed over 62k github stars which is a great feed for a component library specially React component library which already has some tough competetions like:
1. Material ui(92.5k)
2. Ant design(91.5k)
3. Nextui(20.6k) -> Highly Underrated Library! Don't worry about this component libray's stars. The component's this ui libray proviedes is still close to those top 2. 
4. Bootstrap(22.3k) -> Good enough
5. And so on...
You get the idea right. This Shadcn guy is truly legend. Fun Fact I myself started using Twitter or X just to follow this man.
So, from this you can relate that I like this legend a lot. So, as I already told I was following this library from start. And I really wanted to add one of my own made components in this component ui library. I managed to add a all browser based scrollbar and updated code sections for dark theme. But, at that time I was not comfortable using Tailwind cause I love CSS. Yeah, that's true. Don't ask me how but I love CSS. And I knew Tailwind but at that time a I was not much comfortale using Tailwind. So, despite doing all the things and making a pull request. I didn't made to contribute anythign to this library at that time. Cause, at that time shadcn was free and he himself cheaked my codebase. And yeah, I can that I used hex colors when in shadcn/ui they were using hsl css variables as I was not comfortable using Tailwind. So, that's why I didn't updated that code. And then, I was busy in my studies and this way 2023 overed. In 2024, in first couple of months I was still busy in my studies and didn't done any coding for so many time. And after my exams are cleared I choose to do freelancing to earn some money. And ohh, It was not a pleasant expreince. Cause, I am from Bangladesh. And the best freelancing platform from this country is argubly FIVERR. But in 2022, when I am learing Blockchian Technology and at that time I was also doing Freelancing on Fiverr. For, lack of freelance experience I got my FIVERR account BANNED. And that my friend also indeed was a unpleasant experience. Its not something that I done something wrong but at that time I didn't some simple things like it is bad to ask a client to pay by using other payment method other than FIVERR. And for this lack of experience I was BANNED from Fiverr. So, suffering that I choose not to do freelancing for some time. But, I in 2024 I suddently got motivated to do freelancing for magically. Ohh, my bad it is same old problem. The lack of Vitamin "M". So, around June after my collage exams was over. As, I can't create a new Fiverr account I found that Upwork is also quite famause as a freelance platform. So, I have no choice but to create a new Upwork seller account. I once also tried Upwork before in 2022 but didn't even got any client messages so I stopped using this platform. Currently, I managed to get 2 jobs done by doing 2 months of hard works for only 100$. And in this time I got so sick that I barely survied from death. But, still when I told my Client. The Client was like "Is my project ready or not?" LOL

I being a Nextjs, Fullstack develper was payed only 100$ doing extreme hard work for 2 months. Like how bad my luck can be, And I done their jobs in that low amount of money only to get new projects from them. But, despite putting my all and end result also good enough but still I didn't any new projects. Yeah, I clreary got cheated here.

So, after suffering this I was like 'I will again stop doing freelancing and for now will do my own side projects and focus on my studies cause my last exams was not so good'

Then, I remembered about my old goal to contribute to Shadcn/ui. I didn't got surprised to know that Shadcn/ui is already became so popular. So, now I will do a second try to contribute to shadcn/ui.

```
So, I was totally in love with this code library, right? Like, way more than was normal. But then this other thing called Tailwind came along, and I freaked. Freaked out big time!

Freelancing turned into a disaster too. Got banned from one site, made peanuts on another. Big yikes!

But guess what? I went crawling back to my code library love. Just couldn't stay away! The lesson here? We all mess up, but gotta laugh at ourselves and try again. Here's to next time!

Thanks for listning my not so interesting story about my feeling shadcn/ui.
